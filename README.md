This is an academic project for ACT 420 - Accounting Analytics.

The dataset I chose to analyze is about Taxi Trips in Chicago, Illinois that I found from Chicago Data Portal, provided by City of Chicago. 
The dataset contains information on over 200 million taxi trips, spanning from 01/01/2013 to 23/04/2023. 
The dataset includes 23 variables relevant to taxi trips taken in Chicago including trip distances, trip location, trip date and time, payment methods, and trip time. 
In order to take more relevant data to time, I only used data from 01/01/2016 to 12/31/2022.
